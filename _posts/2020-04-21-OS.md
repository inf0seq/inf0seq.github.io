* CVE ID: CVE-2020-13378
* CWE ID: CWE-78


##### Proof of Concept

A command Injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted HTTP request. This is exploitable by an authenticated attacker who submits a modified GET request.


Sample GET request, issuing 'id' OS command returns 'uid=48(apache)'

Identified vulnerable parameters: waf_filename
