Teradata Viewpoint Hardcoded Password Vulnerability

* CVE ID: CVE-2019-6499
* CWE ID: CWE-259

#### Affected products:  
Teradata Viewpoint versions prior to 14.0, but Teradata Viewpoint 16.20.00.02-b80 was found to have that user's account valid too.

#### Summary:
  
Teradata Viewpoint contains database account with hardcoded password that could potentially be exploited by malicious users 
to compromise the affected system. 

#### Details:

Teradata Viewpoint contains hardcoded passwords for database account. Affected database account is "viewpoint". 

viewpoint.db.username=viewpoint
viewpoint.db.password=TDv1i2e3w4

An attacker with local or remote access to the database and knowledge of the password may potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.

Affected file: C:\tdpdk-xx.xx.xx.xx\viewpoint-portal\conf\server.xml

{% highlight ruby %}
<!-- DCS datasource -->
<Resource name="jdbc/dcs"
  auth="Container"
  driverClass="org.postgresql.Driver"

  jdbcUrl="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dcsdb"
  user="viewpoint"
  password="TDv1i2e3w4"

  maxPoolSize="100"
  minPoolSize="1"
  acquireIncrement="1"
  maxIdleTime="120"
  factory="org.apache.naming.factory.BeanFactory"
  type="com.mchange.v2.c3p0.ComboPooledDataSource"/>
{% endhighlight %}

#### Solution:

Restrict network access

As a general security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks.
Restricting access would prevent an attacker from using the hard-coded database credentials from a blocked network location.
